    "1. Use Github classroom to submit your assignment via a Github repo. See the \"Github Classroom Setup\" section at the beginning of this document for details on how to do this. You must commit your solution by the due date and time.\n",
    "1. Double check your submission by \"pretending to be the grader\": clone (or download a zip) your submission repo and run your code in a fresh [continuumio/anaconda3:2021.11](https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/anaconda3) Docker container like we will when we grade your code."

    "## Grading Guidelines\n",
    "This assignment is worth 100 points. Your assignment will be evaluated based on a successful execution in the [continuumio/anaconda3:2021.11](https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/anaconda3) Docker container and adherence to the program requirements. We will grade according to the following criteria:\n",
    "* 10 pts for correct part 1 step 1 (define `test_association_rule_miner_fit()` unit test)\n",
    "* 35 pts for correct part 1 step 2 (finish `fit()` and pass test)\n",
    "* 10 pts for correct part 1 step 3 (finish `print_association_rules()`)\n",
    "* 15 pts for correct part 2 step 1 (titanic rule mining)\n",
    "* 15 pts for correct part 2 step 2 (mushroom rule mining)\n",
    "* 5 pts for no linting problems\n",
    "* 10 pts for adherence to course [coding standard](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GonzagaCPSC322/PAs/blob/master/Coding%20Standard.ipynb), including data storytelling (narrative is clear and grammatically correct, Notebook is organized with headers, formulas are typeset with Latex, code receives a \"good\" `pylint` rating, etc.).\n",
    "    * See [coding standard](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GonzagaCPSC322/PAs/blob/master/Coding%20Standard.ipynb) for details on how to run `pylint` from command line)\n",
    "    * The `pylint` scoring portion of these 10 points is 5 pts scaled to 1/2 of the `pylint` rating, meaning an 8/10 `pylint` rating would score 4/5 pts (rounded to nearest 1/2 integer)"
